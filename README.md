## Overview

**Sudoku – WEBGAME** is a modern, professional, and fully responsive web game developed in a single-page application. This version faithfully recreates the classic 9x9 Sudoku puzzle with:

- **Complete Game Logic:**  
  Utilizes a backtracking algorithm to generate a complete solution and then removes cells according to the selected difficulty to create a unique, solvable puzzle.
  
- **Real-Time Input Validation:**  
  As players fill in the blank cells, the game immediately highlights any errors (duplicate numbers in a row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).

- **Responsive & Playable UI:**  
  The grid is sizable (630px square) for comfortable play on desktops and scales properly on mobile devices using CSS Grid and media queries.
  
- **Additional Features:**  
  A timer records the gameplay time, and buttons are provided for starting a new game, resetting the current puzzle, and viewing a detailed Help modal. A message area displays feedback during gameplay.
  
- **Modern Design:**  
  The interface employs a modern, minimal look with a sticky header and footer. The footer displays “© 2025 Bocaletto Luca” and remains at the bottom of the page.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The Sudoku grid is centered and uses fixed dimensions on larger screens (630px by 630px) and scales gracefully on smaller devices.

- **Puzzle Generation using Backtracking:**  
  A robust algorithm generates a complete solution first then selectively removes cells according to the chosen difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme) to ensure a unique solution.

- **Real-Time Cell Validation:**  
  Cells update live as you type and visually indicate any rule violations by highlighting errors.

- **Timer & Game Controls:**  
  A game timer displays the elapsed time. Users can start a new game, reset the current puzzle, or view help via dedicated buttons.

- **Help Modal:**  
  A detailed help modal explains the rules and instructions so players can quickly familiarize themselves with the game.
